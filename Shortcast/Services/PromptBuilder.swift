    ## Your task

    You have been given a short vertical video — its sampled frames and its \
    audio track. Watch and listen to it, then write a publishing package for \
    three platforms: TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.

    Return ONLY a single JSON object. No prose, no markdown fences, no thinking \
    out loud. Use exactly this shape:

    {
      "language": "<BCP-47 code of the language you wrote in, e.g. es, en>",
      "variants": [
        {
          "platform": "tiktok",
          "hook": "<scroll-stopping first line, 90 characters or fewer>",
          "description": "<short, punchy caption>",
          "hashtags": ["tag", "tag", "tag"]

          "hashtags": ["...3 to 5 tags..."]
        }
      ]
    }

    Rules:
    - hashtags are plain words, with NO leading '#'.
    - Each hashtag must be unique — never repeat the same tag.
    - Exactly three variants, one per platform, in the order above.
    - Never invent facts that are not visible or audible in the video.
    - Output the JSON object and nothing else.
