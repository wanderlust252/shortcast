## What it does

Shortcast has two modes:

### 🎬 Make shorts from a long video (the main one)

Drop a podcast, talk, stream or any long recording. Shortcast transcribes it on-device,
finds the **best 3–6 viral moments**, cuts each one, and writes the **full post copy for
all three platforms** — all in one pass. Horizontal (16:9) footage is **reframed to
vertical 9:16**, tracking the speaker's face. You get a grid of finished shorts you can
play with sound, edit, download, publish, or **schedule one-per-day across the week**.

### ✏️ Caption a short

Already have a short vertical clip? Drop it and Shortcast **watches the frames and hears
the audio** (Gemma 4 E4B, multimodal) and writes the three platform captions directly,
rendered as editable phone-style previews.

What's different about Shortcast:

- 🛰️ **Nothing leaves your Mac during processing.** No cloud model, no upload.
  Your video is only sent to a network when you choose to publish it.
- 🧠 **One model does the thinking.** A single on-device LLM reads the whole transcript,
  picks the moments *and* writes every caption in the same pass.
- 🎯 **Tuned per platform.** TikTok gets punchy. Instagram gets storytelling and 20–30
  hashtags. YouTube gets short, search-friendly titles — in the language spoken in the video.
- 📐 **Auto vertical reframe.** On-device face tracking (Vision) turns 16:9 into 9:16,
  panning to keep the speaker centred, with a blurred-background fallback when there's no
  clear face.
- 🗓️ **Schedule the week in one click.** Distribute approved shorts one per day, pick the
  time, and Upload-Post publishes them automatically.
- 🪶 **No Python. No Electron. No embedded runtime.** Just Swift, MLX, AVFoundation, Vision.

Concretely:

1. **Transcribe.** If the video has a `.srt`/`.vtt` sidecar, it's used instantly.
   Otherwise **WhisperKit** (`large-v3`) transcribes on the GPU. The transcript's
   language is detected from the *text* (NaturalLanguage), so captions stay in the
   spoken language.
2. **Find the moments + write the copy.** The **Director** — an on-device LLM — reads the
   whole transcript and returns a single JSON: the best clips (start/end, why, hook, a
   short on-screen overlay) **and** the full TikTok / Instagram / YouTube caption package
   for each, in one pass. A tolerant parser strips fences/thinking and validates clip
   durations.
3. **Cut.** AVFoundation cuts each moment to its own file.
4. **Reframe (optional, automatic for horizontal clips).** Vision samples faces across
   the clip; if the speaker is found, an `AVMutableVideoComposition` pans a 9:16 crop to
   follow them (GPU-interpolated transform ramps). No clear face → a blurred-background
   letterbox. A short text **hook** can be burned over the top.
5. **Review.** A grid of phone-style tiles — loop each short, play it with sound, edit the
   captions, download the rendered `.mp4`, or approve it.
6. **Publish or schedule.** Publish now, or **schedule the week**: approved shorts go out
   one per day at a time you choose, via Upload-Post's `scheduled_date`. TikTok lands as a
   draft by default so you can finish in-app.

### Choosing the model

Settings → *Caption writer* picks the on-device model that finds the moments and writes
the captions:

| Model | Role | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Gemma 4 12B** (default) | Director + inline captions | Strongest writing, one model, one pass. Loaded via MLX. |
| **Qwen 3.5 9B** | Director + inline captions | Lighter and a bit faster, one pass. Huge context window. |
| **Gemma 4 E4B** | Clip-watching copywriter | Multimodal — *watches* each clip (frames + audio) and captions it in a separate pass. Also the model used by *Caption a short*. |

The model downloads once on first use. Everything runs offline afterwards.

## Install

> Releases are unsigned (not yet notarized), so macOS Gatekeeper blocks them the
> first time. This is expected — one Terminal command fixes it.

1. Download `Shortcast.dmg` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Shortcast** to your Applications folder.
3. Strip the download-quarantine flag, then open the app normally:

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Shortcast.app
   ```

   Now double-click Shortcast and it launches.

> [!NOTE]
> **Seeing “Shortcast.app is damaged and can’t be opened”?** That's the same
> Gatekeeper quarantine — on Apple Silicon, recent macOS shows *“damaged”*
> instead of *“unidentified developer”* and hides the **Open Anyway** button. The
> app is **not** actually damaged; the `xattr` command above is the fix.

<details>
<summary>Prefer the GUI? (older macOS)</summary>

Double-click Shortcast, then open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll
to the message about Shortcast and click **Open Anyway**. On recent macOS this
button often doesn't appear for unsigned apps — use the Terminal command instead.
</details>

### First run

- Shortcast downloads the models it needs on first use, with a visible progress bar:
  the **Director** (Gemma 4 12B ≈ 7 GB, or Qwen 3.5 9B ≈ 5 GB) and **WhisperKit
  large-v3** for transcription. Happens once, then it works offline.
- Open **Settings** (⌘,) and choose a publishing provider. Upload-Post needs an
  [Upload-Post](https://upload-post.com) **API key** and **profile name**. TikTok
  official API needs a TikTok user access token; see
  [docs/tiktok-official-publishing.md](docs/tiktok-official-publishing.md).
- Optionally set a caption language and paste a few of your own captions as style
  examples — the model will match your voice.

You can generate shorts without a publishing provider; only publishing/scheduling needs one.

## Build from source

You need **Xcode 16+** and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).
On Apple Silicon. macOS 15+.

```bash
brew install xcodegen
git clone https://github.com/mutonby/shortcast
cd shortcast
xcodegen generate
open Shortcast.xcodeproj
```

Build and run the **Shortcast** scheme. The `.xcodeproj` is generated from
`project.yml` and intentionally not committed — `xcodegen` regenerates it.

> CLI builds need `-skipMacroValidation`:
>
> **Debug build:**
> ```bash
> xcodebuild -project Shortcast.xcodeproj -scheme Shortcast \
>   -configuration Debug -skipMacroValidation -destination 'platform=macOS' build
> ```
>
> **Release build:**
> ```bash
> xcodebuild -project Shortcast.xcodeproj -scheme Shortcast \
>  -configuration Release -skipMacroValidation -destination 'platform=macOS' \
>  SYMROOT=$(pwd)/build build
> ```

### Release DMG

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds an unsigned `.dmg` and attaches it to the
GitHub Release whenever a `v*` tag is pushed:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## Privacy

Transcription, moment-finding, captioning, cutting and reframing all run inside the app,
on your Mac. The only outbound traffic before you publish is:

- **First use only**: one-time downloads of the model weights from Hugging Face.
- **On Publish / Schedule**: an upload to the selected publishing provider with the
  rendered short and the copy you approved. Upload-Post can publish/schedule multiple
  networks; TikTok official API uploads only TikTok.

Publishing credentials are stored locally on your Mac (app preferences) and are only sent
to their provider over HTTPS when needed. They are never written into the repository.

## Known limitations

- The **Director** runs a large model on-device. On an M1 Pro, a ~2-minute video takes a
  few minutes end-to-end (transcription + generation). Faster Macs (M3/M4) are quicker.
- *Caption a short* uses Gemma 4 E4B, whose audio encoder hears the **first 30 seconds**.
- The app is **unsigned** (see *Install*). Code signing + notarization will come once the
  project stabilises.
- One video at a time — no history, no batch processing. By design, for now.
- Upload-Post free tier limits monthly uploads. One publish to three networks counts as
  three.
